<h3>Full Screen</h3>

<p>Use this command to toggle full screen mode. In full screen mode, the <a href="../../View/View.htm">view</a> is enlarged to fill the entire monitor, and all other application windows are hidden, including the menus and caption bar. The <a href="../../Reference/Shortcuts.htm">shortcut keys</a> still work however.

<p>To enter full screen mode, use <span class="cmd">Window/Full Screen</span> or press <span class="key">F11</span>. To exit full screen mode, press <span class="key">F11</span> or the Escape key. If your Windows desktop spans multiple monitors, drag the application onto the desired monitor before going full screen.
