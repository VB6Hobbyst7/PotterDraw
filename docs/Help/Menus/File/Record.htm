<h3>Record</h3>

<p>Use this command to record a video of an <a href="../../Properties/View/Animation.htm">animation</a>. The video is recorded as a series of sequentially-numbered image files, which must be converted to a video using additional software such as ffmpeg or VLC. To start recording, use <span class="cmd">File/Record</span> or the Record button on the main Toolbar.

<p>The Record command first displays a folder dialog. Use the folder dialog to select a destination folder for the image files, and then press OK. Next the Record dialog is displayed. Use the Record dialog to specify the recording's duration (in time or frames), its frame rate in frames per second, its frame size in pixels, the image file format, and whether to automatically start animating and/or <a href="../../Menus/View/Rotation.htm#Auto_Rotate">auto-rotating</a> when recording begins. Press OK to start recording.

<p>During recording, the <a href="../../Menus/View/Record_Status.htm">Record Status</a> dialog is displayed, so that you can tell how far along the recording is, and cancel it if necessary. Note that the application's user interface may be sluggish during recording, due to the overhead of creating image files, particularly for large frame sizes.

<p>The usual reason to make a video is to show auto-rotation, animation, or both. If neither of these features is enabled, the recording may be dull. Note that for animation to do anything you must have at least one <a href="../../Modulation/Modulation.htm">modulation</a> with a non-zero <a href="../../Modulation/Phase_Speed.htm">Phase Speed</a>. It's difficult (but not impossible) to manually change the pot's <a href="../../Properties/Properties.htm">properties</a> during recording, due to the aforementioned sluggishness of the user interface.

<tr><th>Item</th><th>Comments</th></tr>
<tr><td>Duration</td><td>Use this edit box to enter the recording's duration. Use the radio buttons to specify what unit the duration is in. If the unit is Time, the duration is hours, minutes, and seconds in H:MM:SS format. Otherwise it's a frame count.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Frame Rate</td><td>Use this edit box to enter the recording's frame rate, in frames per second. Fractional frame rates are permitted. For best results, specify this same frame rate in whatever software you use to convert the image files to a video.</td></tr>
<td>Frame Size</td><td>Use this drop list to select the recording's frame size, in pixels. If the desired dimensions aren't listed, select Custom and use the Width and Height edit boxes to enter the dimensions.</td></tr>
<td>File Format</td><td>Use this drop list to specify which image file format the recording should use. Note that using PNG format will usually result in smaller files without any loss of quality, but may slow the recording process, due to compression overhead.</td></tr>
<td>Auto Rotate</td><td>Check this if you want the pot to automatically rotate during the recording.</td></tr>
<td>Animation</td><td>Check this if you want the pot to animate during the recording.</td></tr>
