<h3>Step Backward</h3>

<p>Use this command to step animated <a href="../../Modulation/Modulation.htm">modulations</a> backward by one frame. Combined with <a href="../../Menus/View/Step_Forward.htm">Step Forward</a>, this lets you move to a precise position within an <a href="../../Properties/View/Animation.htm">animation</a> by stepping through it one frame at a time. This can be useful for fine-tuning an image or model prior to <a href="../../Menus/File/Export.htm">exporting</a> it. The command is only available while the animation is stopped. The shortcut is <span class="key">Ctrl+Shift+Space</span>.

<p>Only <em>animated</em> modulations (those with a non-zero <a href="../../Modulation/Phase_Speed.htm">Phase Speed</a>) are affected. The affected <a href="../../Properties/Properties.htm">properties</a> will have orange upward-pointing triangles to the left of their names in the Properties bar. If no animated modulations exist, the command is disabled.
