<h3>Random Phase</h3>

<p>Use this command to jump to a random position within an <a href="../../Properties/View/Animation.htm">animation</a>. The command sets the <a href="../../Modulation/Phase.htm">phase</a> of every animated <a href="../../Modulation/Modulation.htm">modulation</a> to a random value. By using this command repeatedly, you can explore an animation's <em>phase space</em>, i.e. its range of possible states. The animation can be running or stopped. The shortcut is <span class="key">F9</span>.

<p>Only <em>animated</em> modulations (those with a non-zero <a href="../../Modulation/Phase_Speed.htm">Phase Speed</a>) are affected. The affected <a href="../../Properties/Properties.htm">properties</a> will have green or orange upward-pointing triangles to the left of their names in the Properties bar. If no animated modulations exist, the command is disabled.
