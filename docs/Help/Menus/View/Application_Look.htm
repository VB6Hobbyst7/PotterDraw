<h3>Application Look</h3>

<p>This submenu allows you to customize PotterDraw's appearance. The different looks correspond to various versions of Windows.

<a name="Tabs"><p><b>Tabs</b></a>
<p>This command enables or disables the tabbed MDI (Multiple Document Interface) look, which is common in newer applications. Tabbed MDI shows a row of tabs above the <a href="../../View/View.htm">view</a>. The tabs allow you to switch between different documents, and can also be reordered via dragging. However the disadvantage of tabbed MDI is that only one document can be shown at a time.

<p>The classic non-tabbed MDI can show multiple documents at once, and supports the <a href="../../Menus/Window/Cascade.htm">Cascade</a>, <a href="../../Menus/Window/Tile_Horizontal.htm">Tile Horizontal</a>, <a href="../../Menus/Window/Tile_Vertical.htm">Tile Vertical</a> and <a href="../../Menus/Window/Arrange_Icons.htm">Arrange Icons</a> commands. To use the older MDI, disable Tabs.
