<h3>Opposite Wall</h3>

<p>This command enables or disables horizontal mirroring in the <a href="../../Spline/Spline.htm">spline</a> window. Mirroring shows you what the opposite wall of the pot will look like at all times. This is useful because it provides immediate visual feedback during spline <a href="../../Spline/Spline.htm#Dragging_segments_and_nodes">dragging</a>, unlike the <a href="../../View/View.htm">view</a> which normally only updates when spline dragging is complete. You can configure PotterDraw to continuously update the view during spline dragging, by setting the <a href="../../Options/Show_Spline_Drag_in_View.htm">Show Spline Drag in View</a> option to true, but note that doing so may degrade performance.
