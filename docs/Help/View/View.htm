<h3>View</h3>

<p>PotterDraw's main view shows the pot in 3D. The view is read-only. To change the pot, edit its <a href="../Spline/Spline.htm">spline</a> or other <a href="../Properties/Properties.htm">properties</a>.

<p>To rotate the pot, left-click and drag the cursor while keeping the left mouse button pressed. The cursor affects pitch and yaw, i.e. rotation around the x and y axes. To roll, i.e. to rotate the pot around the z-axis, also press the <span class="key">Shift</span> key and drag the cursor horizontally.

<p>To zoom in or out, position the cursor at the desired location and spin the mouse wheel. The <span class="key">Ctrl+=</span> and <span class="key">Ctrl+-</span> shortcuts also work, and <span class="key">Ctrl+0</span> resets the zoom.

<p>To pan the view, press the middle mouse button and drag the cursor while keeping the middle mouse button pressed.

<p>The view supports various <a href="../View/Render_Styles.htm">render styles</a>.

<p>By default PotterDraw uses tabbed MDI. If you prefer the classic non-tabbed MDI look, you can enable it via the <a href="../Menus/View/Application_Look.htm#Tabs">Tabs</a> command.
