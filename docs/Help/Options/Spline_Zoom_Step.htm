<h3>Spline Zoom Step</h3>

<p>This is the percentage by which the <a href="../Spline/Spline.htm">spline</a> window zooms for each step of the mouse wheel. The <a href="../Menus/View/Zoom_In.htm">zoom in</a> and <a href="../Menus/View/Zoom_Out.htm">zoom out</a> commands and their shortcuts also use this step size when the spline window has focus. Increase it to make zooming faster but coarser; decrease it to make zooming slower but more precise. Note that the <a href="../View/View.htm">view</a> has its own independent <a href="../Options/Zoom_Step.htm">Zoom Step</a>.
