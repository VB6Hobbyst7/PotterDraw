<h3>Floating-Point Precision</h3>

<p>This is the number of digits after the decimal point for <a href="../Menus/File/Export.htm#3D_exports">3D exports</a> that store values as ASCII text, as opposed to binary. Currently only the Wavefront OBJ export respects this setting. More digits will make the exported model more precise, but at the cost of increased file size. At the upper limit (17 digits), text exports are as precise as binary exports.
