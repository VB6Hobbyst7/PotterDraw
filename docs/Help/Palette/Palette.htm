<h3>Palette</h3>

<p>The palette lets you choose the colors used for <a href="../Palette/Texture_synthesis.htm">texture synthesis</a>. To show the Palette bar, use <span class="cmd">View/Toolbars and Docking Windows/Palette</span>. The palette bar has two components: a color picker on top, and underneath it a color bar, containing a row of square color swatches, one for each color in the palette. Note that if the pot's texture is a <a href="../Properties/Texture/Texture_Path.htm">user-specified image file</a>, changing the palette has no effect.

<a name="Editing_a_color"><p><b>Editing a color</b></a>
<p>One of the swatches in the color bar has a highlight around it. This highlight indicates which of your palette's colors is displayed and editable in the color picker. To change the selected color, left-click a different color swatch. You can also use the arrow keys to scroll through the color swatches.

<p>To edit a color, first select it the color bar as explained above. Then use the color picker to change its value as desired, and press the Apply button to save your change and update the <a href="../View/View.htm">view</a>. The color picker has two pages, Standard and Custom, which are explained below.

<a name="Standard_color_picker"><p><b>Standard color picker</b></a>
<p>The Standard color picker limits you to the colors displayed on its hexagonal tiles. If one of these colors is acceptable, simply left-click it and press Apply. Pressing the <span class="key">Enter</span> key is equivalent to pressing Apply. You can also double-click one of the hexagonal tiles, which picks the color and applies the change immediately, in which case there's no need to press the Apply button.

<a name="Custom_color_picker"><p><b>Custom color picker</b></a>
<p>The Custom color picker lets you pick any color, by adjusting the hue/saturation and lightness positions, or by entering numeric HLS or RGB values. The new and current colors are displayed on the right, below the buttons. When the new color is changed as desired, be sure to press Apply to save your change. Pressing the <span class="key">Enter</span> key is equivalent to pressing Apply.

<a name="Palette_editing_commands"><p><b>Palette editing commands</b></a>
<p>The palette can be reordered by dragging the color bar's swatches. You can also <a href="../Menus/Edit/Copy.htm">copy</a>, <a href="../Menus/Edit/Cut.htm">cut</a> and <a href="../Menus/Edit/Paste.htm">paste</a> individual swatches using the standard Windows editing keys <span class="key">Ctrl+C</span>, <span class="key">Ctrl+X</span>, and <span class="key">Ctrl+V</span>, or via the color bar's context menu. Use the Insert key to insert a swatch, or the Delete key to <a href="../Menus/Edit/Delete.htm">delete</a> a swatch.
