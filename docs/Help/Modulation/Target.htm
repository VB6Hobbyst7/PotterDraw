<h3>Target</h3>

<p>This specifies which PotterDraw <a href="../Properties/Properties.htm">property</a> the <a href="../Modulation/Modulation.htm">Modulation</a> bar is currently affecting, also known as the <em>target</em> property. It contains a drop list of all the <a href="../Properties/Properties.htm">properties</a> that can be modulated. You can also change the modulation target by left-clicking a property name in the Properties bar.

<p>Most target properties are floating-point values, but enumerated values such as <a href="../Properties/Mesh/Scallop/Scallop_Motif.htm">Scallop Motif</a> can also be modulated. Note that the following properties can't be modulated: <a href="../Properties/Mesh/Rings.htm">Rings</a>, <a href="../Properties/Mesh/Sides.htm">Sides</a>, <a href="../Properties/Texture/Texture_Path.htm">Texture Path</a>, <a href="../Properties/Texture/Colors.htm">Colors</a>, <a href="../Properties/Texture/Color_Sharpness.htm">Color Sharpness</a>, and <a href="../Properties/Texture/Palette_Type.htm">Palette Type</a>.
