<h3>Phase Speed</h3>

<p>This sets how rapidly the <a href="../Modulation/Modulation.htm">modulation</a> changes <a href="../Modulation/Phase.htm">phase</a> during <a href="../Properties/View/Animation.htm">animation</a>, in Hertz (cycles per second). Note that this property is only effective while animation is enabled, otherwise it's ignored. If it's zero, time has no effect on the oscillator. If it's negative, the oscillator runs backwards. Normally the modulation also varies with vertical position, but you can disable this by setting the modulation <a href="../Modulation/Frequency.htm">frequency</a> to zero.
