<h3>Power</h3>

<p>This is the base used for exponential <a href="../Modulation/Modulation.htm">modulation</a>. If it's zero, exponential modulation is disabled. Otherwise, the modulation's curvature becomes more extreme as the power diverges from one, as shown in the table below. This property supports a huge range of values, so it's usually best to change it by large amounts, e.g. powers of ten.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;&nbsp;0</td><td>Not allowed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Linear (disabled).</td></tr>
<tr><td>0&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1</td><td>Starts out curving more steeply and then levels off; the smaller the value, the more extreme the curvature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Linear. Use zero instead to avoid needless computations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&gt;&nbsp;1</td><td>Starts out curving more gradually and then gets steeper; the larger the value, the more extreme the curvature.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Exponential modulation is also affected by <a href="../Modulation/Power_Type.htm">Power Type</a>. If the power type is <em>asymmetric</em>, the wave's upper and lower halves are affected differently, in which case a given power and its reciprocal (e.g. 10 and 0.1) produce mirror images of each other. If the power type is <em>symmetric</em>, the wave's upper and lower halves are affected equally, and the wave's vertical symmetry (if any) is preserved. The image below shows how a range of powers affect a sine wave, for both power types. Other <a href="../Modulation/Waveform.htm">waveforms</a> respond similarly.
