<h3>Operation</h3>

<p>This lets you specify how the <a href="../Modulation/Modulation.htm">modulation</a> affects the <a href="../Modulation/Target.htm">target</a> property. The following operations are available:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Operation</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Add</td><td>The modulation output is added to the target property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Subtract</td><td>The modulation output is subtracted from the target property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Multiply</td><td>The target property is multiplied by the modulation output.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Divide</td><td>The target property is divided by the modulation output. The user is responsible for ensuring that the modulation doesn't output zero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exponentiate</td><td>The waveform is used as an exponent, and the target property is multiplied by two raised to that exponent.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Exponentiate is optimal for proportional scaling. For example if the waveform ranges from &minus;1 to 1, Exponentiate produces values ranging from 2<sup>&minus;1</sup> to 2<sup>1</sup>, i.e. from &frac12; to 2. Thus the effect ranges from halving to doubling. Note that this assumes <a href="../Modulation/Amplitude.htm">Amplitude</a> is one. If Amplitude were two, Exponentiate would produce values ranging from 2<sup>&minus;2</sup> to 2<sup>2</sup>, i.e. from &frac14; to 4 instead.
