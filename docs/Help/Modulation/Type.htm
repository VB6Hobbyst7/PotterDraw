<h3>Type</h3>

<p>This enables <a href="../Modulation/Secondary_modulation.htm">secondary modulation</a>, an <b>advanced feature</b>. If you're new to PotterDraw, leave this set to "Property". This setting changes the meaning of both the <a href="../Modulation/Modulation.htm">modulation</a> bar and the <a href="../Oscilloscope/Oscilloscope.htm">oscilloscope</a>, as explained below.

<tr><th>Type</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Comment</th></tr>
<tr><td>Property</td><td>Primary modulation</td><td>The modulation bar edits the <em>primary modulation</em>, i.e. the LFO that directly modulates the currently selected <a href="../Modulation/Target.htm">target</a> property. Similarly, the oscilloscope plots the modulated target property. This is the default setting. Don't change it unless you're an advanced user.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Any other value</td><td>Secondary modulation</td><td>The modulation bar edits a <em>secondary modulation</em>, i.e. an LFO that modulates one of the primary modulation's properties. This allows modulation of a modulation, also known as <em>second-order</em> modulation. In this case the oscilloscope plots the secondary modulation instead of the target property, and the name of the affected modulation property is highlighted in red as a reminder.</td></tr>
