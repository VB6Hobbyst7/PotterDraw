<h3>Pulse Width</h3>

<p>This property only affects pulse <a href="../Modulation/Waveform.htm">waveforms</a>, and together with <a href="../Modulation/Slew.htm">Slew</a> it determines the pulse's shape. Also known as <em>duty cycle</em>, Pulse Width is the fraction of the cycle occupied by the pulse, normalized to the range zero to one. If pulse width is zero, the pulse is non-existent. If it's one, the pulse occupies the entire cycle. If it's 0.5, the pulse occupies half the cycle.
