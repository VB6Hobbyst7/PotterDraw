<h3>Frequency</h3>

<p>This sets the frequency of the <a href="../Modulation/Modulation.htm">modulation</a> oscillator. The frequency is in cycles per pot height, i.e. if the frequency is one, the waveform does one complete cycle from the bottom to the top of the pot. If the frequency is zero, the modulation output doesn't vary with vertical position, but it may still vary with time, if <a href="../Modulation/Phase_Speed.htm">phase speed</a> is non-zero and <a href="../Properties/View/Animation.htm">animation</a> is enabled.
