<h3>Power Type</h3>

<p>This determines how exponential <a href="../Modulation/Power.htm">power</a> is applied to the <a href="../Modulation/Waveform.htm">waveform</a> during <a href="../Modulation/Modulation.htm">modulation</a>. The available methods are listed below, and illustrated <a href="../Modulation/Power.htm">here</a>.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Power Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Asymmetric</td><td>Power is applied while the wave is <em>unipolar</em>, so that the wave's upper and lower halves are affected differently, giving the wave a lopsided appearance. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Symmetric</td><td>Power is applied while the wave is <em>bipolar</em>, so that the wave's upper and lower halves are affected equally, preserving any vertical symmetry the wave may have.</td></tr>
