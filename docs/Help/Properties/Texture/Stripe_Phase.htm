<h3>Stripe Phase</h3>

<p>This is the initial phase of the <a href="../../Properties/Texture/Stripe_Frequency.htm">stripes</a> waveform, as a <a href="../../Reference/Normalized_angle.htm">normalized angle</a>. This is useful if you want the waveform to start at a phase other than 0&deg;. Note that this property has no effect unless both Stripe Frequency and <a href="../../Properties/Texture/Stripe_Amplitude.htm">Stripe Amplitude</a> are non-zero.
