<h3>Rings</h3>

<p>The pot is constructed as a vertical stack of polygonal rings. This property sets the number of rings in the pot. It's a tradeoff between smoothness and performance: the more rings there are, the smoother the pot's surface is, but the longer it takes to render the pot. Too few rings gives the pot a jagged, faceted appearance; excessive values make the application sluggish. The default value of 100 is a reasonable starting point.

<p>The Rings and <a href="../../Properties/Mesh/Sides.htm">Sides</a> properties together determine the total number of facets, which is approximately Rings &times; Sides &times; 4. The exact number can be displayed via <a href="../../Menus/Tools/Mesh_Information.htm">Mesh Information</a>.
