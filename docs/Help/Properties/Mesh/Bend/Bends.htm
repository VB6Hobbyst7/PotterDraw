<h3>Bends</h3>

<p>This sets the number of bends. Bends are sinusoidal offsets added to the pot's radius. The effect is similar to <a href="../../../Properties/Mesh/Ripple/Ripples.htm">Ripples</a> but with an extra oscillator: in addition to the sine wave applied vertically to the pot's surface, a second sine wave is applied around the circumference of each ring. Bends can be used to create complex surfaces such as S-curves, honeycombs, bumps, and pits. For even more variety, a third oscillator is available; see <a href="../../../Properties/Mesh/Bend/Ruffle/Ruffles.htm">Ruffles</a>. Note that this property has no effect unless <a href="../../../Properties/Mesh/Bend/Bend_Depth.htm">Bend Depth</a> is also non-zero, and for typical usage, <a href="../../../Properties/Mesh/Bend/Bend_Poles.htm">Bend Poles</a> should also be non-zero.
