<h3>Radius</h3>

<p>This is a scaling factor applied to the overall radius of the pot. If it's one (the default), no scaling occurs. Values greater than one widen the pot, while values less than one narrow it. Any value other than one causes the pot to have different proportions than the <a href="../../Spline/Spline.htm">spline</a>. Note that you can also change the radius of the pot by moving the spline towards or away from the x-axis. Unlike the spline, the Radius property can be <a href="../../Modulation/Modulation.htm">modulated</a> with a waveform.
