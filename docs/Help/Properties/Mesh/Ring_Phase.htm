<h3>Ring Phase</h3>

<p>This is the initial phase of each <a href="../../Properties/Mesh/Rings.htm">ring</a>, as a <a href="../../Reference/Normalized_angle.htm">normalized angle</a>. Setting this property rotates the entire pot around its center axis. If you just want to see the pot from a different angle, it's usually preferable to <a href="../../Menus/View/Rotation.htm">rotate</a> the <a href="../../View/View.htm">view</a> instead, because doing so is very efficient, unlike rotating the pot which involves rebuilding the mesh.

<p>This property is primarily intended as a <a href="../../Modulation/Modulation.htm">modulation</a> target, in order to achieve twisting effects by rotating each ring differently. The <a href="../../Properties/Mesh/Twist.htm">Twist</a> property only supports simple linear twisting, whereas modulating Ring Phase allows many other types of twisting. The Twist property is equivalent to modulating Ring Phase with a <a href="../../Modulation/Range.htm">unipolar</a> Ramp Up <a href="../../Modulation/Waveform.htm">waveform</a>. Twist and Ring Phase modulation can also be combined for even more complex effects.
