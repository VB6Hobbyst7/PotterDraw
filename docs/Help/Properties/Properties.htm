<h3>Properties</h3>

<p>PotterDraw supports a list of properties which can be used to enhance the pot's appearance beyond its basic shape, which is determined by its <a href="../Spline/Spline.htm">spline</a>. Properties can also be <a href="../Modulation/Modulation.htm">modulated</a> by oscillators for more complex effects. The properties are explained in detail in the topics below, and summarized <a href="../Reference/Properties_Summary.htm">here</a>. They're grouped into the following categories:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Group</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>
<tr><td>Mesh</td><td>Alterations to the pot's 3D mesh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Texture</td><td>Alterations to the pot's 2D <a href="../Menus/Render/Texture.htm">texture</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>View</td><td><a href="../View/View.htm">View</a>-related properties; also see <a href="../View/Render_Styles.htm">Render Styles</a>.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The properties bar displays the property values for the active document, and lets you edit them. To show the properties bar, use <span class="cmd">View/Toolbars and Docking Windows/Properties</span>. To edit a property, left-click its value. You can also navigate the list using the Up and Down arrows, and edit the selected property by pressing the <span class="key">Tab</span> key. Most properties are either numeric values or lists. The editing features of the different property types are explained below.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>

<tr><td>Numeric</td><td>Left-click the value to display an edit box; then type a new value, or edit the existing value, and press <span class="key">Enter</span> or <span class="key">Tab</span> to save your change. Left-clicking anywhere outside of the value also saves your change. To cancel your change, press <span class="key">Esc</span>.</td></tr>
