<h3>Animation</h3>

<p>This enables or disables the animation of any mesh or texture <a href="../../Properties/Properties.htm">properties</a> that are ready to animate. A property is ready to animate if has an active <a href="../../Modulation/Modulation.htm">modulation</a> with a non-zero <a href="../../Modulation/Phase_Speed.htm">Phase Speed</a>. Modulation and animation readiness are indicated by the presence and color of an upward-pointing triangle to the left of the property's name in the Properties bar, as shown in the table below.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Triangle</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>None</td><td>The property isn't modulated. To modulate it, set its <a href="../../Modulation/Waveform.htm">Waveform</a> to a value other than None, and configure other modulation parameters as needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Blue</td><td>The property is modulated, but not ready to animate. To make it ready, set its Phase Speed to a non-zero value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Orange</td><td>The property is ready to animate, but animation is disabled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Green</td><td>The property is animating.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>To enable animation, set the Animation property to true, or use the <a href="../../Menus/View/Enable_Animation.htm">View/Animation</a> main menu command. Enabling animation causes the <a href="../../View/View.htm">view</a> to automatically update itself at the current <a href="../../Properties/View/Frame_Rate.htm">frame rate</a>. For every frame, PotterDraw iterates through the animated properties and advances their oscillators by the appropriate amount.
