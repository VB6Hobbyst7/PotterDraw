<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>PotterDraw is a free 3D software application for designing and visualizing pottery. It's useful for creating cylindrical shapes such as pots, flasks, vases, bowls, plates, cups, glasses, goblets, or anything similar. The outer wall of the pot is drawn using a <a href="../Spline/Spline.htm">spline</a>, which consists of one or more curved or linear segments. The inner wall is generated automatically.

<p>PotterDraw can <a href="../Menus/File/Export.htm">export</a> files suitable for 3D printing. It can also map <a href="../Palette/Texture_synthesis.htm">synthesized</a> or user-specified textures onto the pot. Mesh and texture <a href="../Properties/Properties.htm">properties</a> can be <a href="../Modulation/Modulation.htm">modulated</a> by oscillators for more complex effects, and the modulations can be <a href="../Properties/View/Animation.htm">animated</a> to create <a href="../Menus/File/Record.htm">videos</a>.
